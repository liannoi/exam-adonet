[//]: # (Short description)

Examination project performed by me at the STEP Computer Academy.

This project is a kind of address accounting application. The main idea is to
perform CRUD operations on the database through a graphical application. For
more convenient data retrieval from the database, it was necessary to describe
the procedure in SQL (T-SQL).

Graphics written in WinForms (Windows Forms) using the MVP architectural
pattern.

The second part of the examination task is writing LINQ queries to a set of
addresses.

**I got 10/12 for work. Teacher: Vasilenko Igor Grigorevich**
